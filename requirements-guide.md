# Requirements Template Usage Guide

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for effectively populating the requirements template created for your kids application project.

## File Locations
- **Main Requirements Document:** `/Users/ankursoni/Desktop/vibe/kids/requirements.md`
- **Original PRD File:** `/Users/ankursoni/Desktop/vibe/kids/prd.md` (currently empty)
- **This Guide:** `/Users/ankursoni/Desktop/vibe/kids/requirements-guide.md`

## How to Use This Template

### Step 1: Executive Summary
Start by filling out the basic project information:
- Replace "Kids Application" with your actual project name
- Update the status as your project progresses
- Add your team member information

### Step 2: Business Objectives (Section 1)
**Priority: High**
- Define 3-5 clear, measurable business goals
- Establish success metrics that can be tracked
- Create detailed user personas based on your target audience

**Example:**
```
Goal 1: Create an educational platform that improves children's reading comprehension by 25%
Success Metric: Track reading assessment scores before/after app usage
Target Audience: Children ages 6-12 with reading skill development needs
```

### Step 3: Functional Requirements (Section 2)
**Priority: Critical**
- Use the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
- Write user stories in the format: "As a [user], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]"
- Include specific, measurable acceptance criteria

**Template for User Stories:**
```
Feature: Interactive Reading Games
User Story: As a parent, I want my child to play reading games so that they can improve their comprehension skills while having fun
Acceptance Criteria:
- Child can select from 10+ age-appropriate reading games
- Progress is tracked and visible to parents
- Games adapt difficulty based on child's performance
```

### Step 4: Non-Functional Requirements (Section 3)
**Priority: High**
Focus on these key areas for a kids application:
- **Performance:** Children have shorter attention spans, so loading times should be minimal (< 1 second)
- **Security:** Enhanced privacy protection for minors, COPPA compliance
- **Usability:** Large buttons, simple navigation, visual feedback
- **Accessibility:** Support for various learning abilities and disabilities

### Step 5: Technical Requirements (Section 4)
Consider these factors for kids applications:
- **Cross-platform compatibility:** iOS, Android, and web browsers
- **Offline functionality:** Children may not always have internet access
- **Parental controls:** Admin interface for parents/teachers
- **Data privacy:** Minimal data collection, secure storage

### Step 6: Dependencies & Constraints (Section 6)
Common considerations for kids apps:
- **Legal:** COPPA compliance, international privacy laws
- **Educational:** Curriculum alignment requirements
- **Technical:** Device compatibility (tablets vs phones)
- **Budget:** Educational pricing considerations

## Requirements Gathering Checklist

### Before You Start
- [ ] Identify all stakeholders (parents, teachers, children, administrators)
- [ ] Research competitor apps and educational standards
- [ ] Define the minimum viable product (MVP) scope
- [ ] Establish budget and timeline constraints

### During Requirements Gathering
- [ ] Conduct user interviews with parents and educators
- [ ] Observe children using similar applications
- [ ] Review educational curriculum requirements
- [ ] Validate technical feasibility with development team

### After Initial Requirements
- [ ] Prioritize features using stakeholder input
- [ ] Validate requirements with user testing/prototypes
- [ ] Review legal and compliance requirements
- [ ] Get formal approval from all stakeholders

## Review Process

### Self-Review Checklist
- [ ] All sections completed with specific, measurable requirements
- [ ] User stories follow proper format with clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are quantifiable
- [ ] Dependencies and risks are identified
- [ ] Requirements are prioritized and traceable

### Stakeholder Review Process
1. **Internal Review:** Development team and project manager
2. **User Review:** Parents, teachers, and target users
3. **Legal Review:** Compliance and privacy requirements
4. **Final Approval:** Project sponsor and key stakeholders

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Incomplete Requirements
- Vague or unmeasurable acceptance criteria
- Missing non-functional requirements
- Undefined user roles or personas
- No mention of privacy/security for minors

### Scope Issues
- Feature creep without proper prioritization
- Unrealistic timeline or budget expectations
- Missing MVP definition
- No consideration for future scalability

### Compliance Gaps
- Missing COPPA compliance requirements
- Inadequate data privacy protections
- No parental consent mechanisms
- Insufficient content moderation

## Next Steps After Requirements Completion

1. **Technical Architecture Planning**
   - System design and technology stack selection
   - Database design and data flow mapping
   - Security architecture planning

2. **Project Planning**
   - Sprint planning and feature breakdown
   - Resource allocation and team assignments
   - Testing strategy and quality assurance planning

3. **Design Phase**
   - UI/UX wireframes and prototypes
   - User testing with target audience
   - Accessibility and usability testing

4. **Development Kickoff**
   - Development environment setup
   - Coding standards and review processes
   - Continuous integration/deployment setup

## Questions to Ask Stakeholders

### For Parents:
- What educational goals do you want the app to support?
- How much screen time is appropriate for your child?
- What safety and privacy controls are most important?
- How do you want to track your child's progress?

### For Educators:
- How does this align with curriculum standards?
- What assessment methods should be integrated?
- How will you use this in classroom settings?
- What reporting do you need for student progress?

### For Children (age-appropriate methods):
- What games/activities do they enjoy most?
- How do they prefer to navigate apps?
- What motivates them to continue using an app?
- What frustrates them about current educational apps?
