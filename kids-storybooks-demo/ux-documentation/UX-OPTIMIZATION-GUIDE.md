## 🔧 Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Component Design Principles

#### 1. Consistency Standards
```typescript
// Standardized prop patterns
interface ComponentProps {
  children?: ReactNode
  className?: string
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline'
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
  disabled?: boolean
  loading?: boolean
}
```

#### 2. Accessibility Requirements
```typescript
// Required accessibility props
interface AccessibleProps {
  'aria-label'?: string
  'aria-describedby'?: string
  role?: string
  tabIndex?: number
}
```

#### 3. Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading:** Implement for story images
- **Code Splitting:** Route-based splitting
- **Memoization:** React.memo for expensive components
- **Virtual Scrolling:** For large story libraries

### State Management Patterns

#### Current Pattern: Local Component State
```typescript
const [stories, setStories] = useState<Story[]>([])
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
```

#### Recommended Pattern: Context + Reducers
```typescript
// Global app state for cross-component data
const AppContext = createContext<AppState>()
const useAppState = () => useContext(AppContext)
```
