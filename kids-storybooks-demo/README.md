## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd kids-storybooks-demo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps

   Note: Uses `--legacy-peer-deps` due to React 18 peer dependency requirements

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `.env.local` with your API keys (for production use)

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 📱 Demo Usage

### Getting Started
